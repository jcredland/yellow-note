# yellow-note
Microsoft's stickies application is horrible.  This is a super simple alternative.  It only supports one note at the moment ... but it's already better than the offical one!

It uses the JUCE framework and should work fine on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 

# Building Instructions

1. Download JUCE from www.juce.com or github.
2. Install the development environment for your platform (Visual Studio, Xcode, GCC etc.)
3. Compile the Introjucer from JUCE (see extras/Introjucer).
4. Open the YellowNote.jucer file in Introjucer. 
5. Save the project for your IDE and build it. 

I'll put some binaries up at some point :)
